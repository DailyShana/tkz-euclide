## [5.14c] — unreleased
### Fixed
- `\tkzDefCircle[orthogonal from=…]` / `[orthogonal through=…]`: the choice leaked globally; every later `\tkzDefCircle(A,B,C)` without option failed.
- `\tkzShowLine`: options were global (`parallel`, `orthogonal`, `bisector` stayed active in the following pictures); the mediator is again the default at each call.
- `\tkzDefSimilitudeCenter`: `int`/`ext` stayed active for the following calls.
- `\tkzIsLinear` always answered true; `\tkzIsLinear` and `\tkzIsOrtho` now use a tolerance relative to the lengths (0.06°).
- `\tkzPowerCircle`: the result is frozen (it changed after another calculation).
- `\tkzCalcLength`: `cm=false` no longer persists to the following calls.
- `\tkzDefCircleBy[inversion=…]`: a circle passing near (less than 1 cm) the centre of inversion was transformed into a line.
- `\tkzDefCircle[spieker]`: `\tkzGetLength` gives the radius in cm like the other circles.
- `\tkzDefTriangleCenter[feuerbach]` sometimes returned the wrong point; `\tkzDefSpcTriangle[feuerbach]` now uses the line nine-point centre–excenter (exact tangency points).
- `\tkzDrawPolySeg`: no more zero-length first segment (wrong start arrow with `<->`).
- `\tkzCompass` accepts a decimal `delta`.
- `\tkzProtractor[return]` had no effect.
- `\tkzLabelRegPolygon` uses its `sep` option; `\tkzDrawX` uses its `step` option like `\tkzDrawY`.
- `\tkzDrawCircle` / `\tkzFillCircle` with three points (v3 syntax) gave an endless loop; a clear error is now given.
- Options of `\tkzGrid`, `\tkzClip`, `\tkzDefEquiPoints` and `\tkzLegend` are local to the call.
- Aliases `\tkzDefNinePointsCircle`, `\tkzFeuerBachCircle` and `\tkzIncentralTriangle` pointed to undefined macros.
- `tkz-euclide.sty`: `\RequirePackage{xpatch}`, warning instead of an undefined `\PatchFailed`, dead second `\ProcessOptions` removed.

### Changed
- `\tkzSetUpCompass[delta=…]` only acts on compass marks; arcs (`\tkzDrawArc`, `\tkzMarkArc`, `\tkzLabelArc`) are set with `\tkzSetUpArc[delta=…]`.
- The TikZ style `help lines` is no longer redefined for the whole document; `\tkzHelpGrid` is unchanged.

## [5.13c] — 2026/01/25
### Fixed
   - Harmonization of file dates.
   - Simplification and correction of file headers.
   - Creating a repository on GitHub.
   - Added a warning for using the **mini** option in conjunction with **tkz-elements**:

   Some macros, such as those in the `tkz-draw-eu-show.tex` file, still require the use of the complete package.

---
## [5.12c] — 2026/01/22
### Fixed
- Macro `\tkzAutoLabelPoints`.
- Modification of files loaded with the `mini` option. If you encounter difficulties, do not use this option because some macros require the use of macros for calculations.

### Docs
- Correction  Example with `\tkzAutoLabelPoints`.


---
